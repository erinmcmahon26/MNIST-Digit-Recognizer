# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
1. Fit a random forest classifier.
2. Record the time it takes to fit the model and then evaluate the model.
3. Execute principal components analysis (PCA) generating principal components that represent 95 percent of the variability in the explanatory variables.
4. Record the time it takes to identify the principal components.
5. Using the identified principal components from step (2), use the data to build another random forest classifier.
6. Record the time it takes to fit the model and to evaluate the model.
7. Use k-means clustering to group MNIST observations into 1 of 10 categories and then assign labels.
8. Look at the optimal k and compare the difference between models with k=10 and k=optimal.
